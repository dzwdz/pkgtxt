pkgtxt - manage installed packages with a file

pkgtxt brings the file based package management of Alpine Linux' apk to other
package managers (the only currently supported package manager is pacman).

To add new packages, add them to the /etc/pkg.txt file.
To remove packages, simply delete them from the /etc/pkgs.txt file.

# Installation
To install pkgtxt, run the ./install script as root. It will
create the /etc/pkg.txt file.

# To be implemented
Pacman installation hooks which add packages to /etc/pkg.txt.
Safeguards against removing system-critical packages.

# Contributing
Patches are welcome! It would be great to add support for package managers other
than pacman.
